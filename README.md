## Exploring the Veeam API with Python

This is a repo for a Jupyter Notebook with some Veeam API exporation using Python. (Yes I know I spelled the repo incorrectly!)

It is intended as an introduction to people that haven't used the API before and want some insights into how to work with it.

It does assume some familiarity with Python and the PIP install process to install some of the referenced libraries.

To install Jupyter Lab (recommended) simply enter in CMD:

    pip install jupyterlab

Then to run:

    jupyter notebook
